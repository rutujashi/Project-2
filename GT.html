    <h3>INFORMATION OF GT</h3>
    <p>
      Gujarat Titans (GT) is a professional franchise cricket team that
      represents the state of Gujarat in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and is
      one of the newer teams in the tournament, having made its debut in IPL
      2022. The team is owned by CVC Capital Partners and plays its home matches
      at the iconic Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, the largest cricket
      stadium in the world, known for hosting high-profile national and
      international matches. Gujarat Titans created history by delivering an
      outstanding performance in their debut season by winning the IPL 2022
      title, which instantly established them as a strong and well-organized
      franchise. GT is known for its calm leadership, disciplined bowling
      attack, and efficient team strategy, focusing on teamwork rather than
      individual brilliance alone. The franchise has quickly built a strong fan
      base across Gujarat and neighboring regions due to its consistent
      performances and professional management. Over the seasons, Gujarat Titans
      have continued to be a competitive side, regularly challenging top teams
      and qualifying for the playoffs. In IPL 2026, Gujarat Titans remain an
      important and exciting team in the league, bringing stability, confidence,
      and high-quality cricket to the tournament while continuing to enhance the
      popularity of the IPL among fans across India and around the world.
