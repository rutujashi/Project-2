    <h3>INFORMATION OF RR</h3>
    <p>
      Rajasthan Royals (RR) is a professional franchise cricket team that
      represents the state of Rajasthan in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and
      is one of the original teams of the tournament, having been part of the
      league since its inaugural season in 2008. The team is famously known for
      winning the first-ever IPL title in 2008 under the leadership of Shane
      Warne, which made Rajasthan Royals a symbol of smart strategy, teamwork,
      and the successful use of young and underrated players. RR plays its home
      matches at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, a historic venue known
      for its passionate cricket fans and balanced pitch conditions. The
      franchise is owned by Emerging Media IPL Ltd, with strong backing from the
      Royals Sports Group, and is well known for its focus on talent scouting
      and player development, especially giving opportunities to young Indian
      cricketers. Over the years, Rajasthan Royals have built a reputation for
      playing fearless and disciplined cricket, often outperforming expectations
      despite having fewer big-name stars compared to some other teams. The team
      has consistently contributed to the growth of Indian cricket by nurturing
      future stars and maintaining a strong team culture. In IPL 2026, Rajasthan
      Royals continue to be a competitive and exciting team in the league,
      combining experience with youth, and remain popular among fans for their
      fighting spirit, strategic approach, and commitment to entertaining
      cricket.
