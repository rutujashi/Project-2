    <h3>INFORMATION OF PBKS</h3>
    <p>
      Punjab Kings (PBKS) is a professional franchise cricket team that
      represents the state of Punjab in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and has
      been part of the tournament since its inaugural season in 2008, earlier
      known as Kings XI Punjab before being rebranded as Punjab Kings in 2021.
      The team plays its home matches at the IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali, which
      is known for its lively pitch and enthusiastic crowd support. PBKS is
      jointly owned by Preity Zinta, Ness Wadia, Mohit Burman, and Karan Paul,
      making it one of the most well-known franchises in terms of celebrity
      ownership. Over the years, Punjab Kings have been recognized for their
      aggressive playing style, powerful batting lineups, and willingness to
      back young and emerging talent. Although the team has reached the IPL
      final once in 2014, they have often faced challenges in maintaining
      consistency across seasons. Despite this, PBKS continues to be a
      competitive and entertaining side, frequently producing thrilling matches
      and standout individual performances. The franchise enjoys a loyal fan
      base, especially in Punjab and northern India, due to its fighting spirit
      and never-give-up attitude. In IPL 2026, Punjab Kings continue their
      efforts to build a balanced and strong team, aiming for consistent
      performances and playoff success while contributing exciting cricket and
      entertainment to the Indian Premier League.
